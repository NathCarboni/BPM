Migration from Oracle BPM to Oracle Autonomous Integration Cloud - Streamlining Process Automation in the Cloud
https://andreboaventurablog.wordpress.com/2018/06/07/migration-from-oracle-bpm-automated-processes-to-oracle-autonomous-integration-cloud-streamlining-process-automation-in-the-cloud/

Here is an outline of steps to use the Oracle BPM to Cloud migration framework

1) Download the .zip of this branch by clicking on the button "Clone or Download"
2) Unzip the project in any folder you want to. Please note that the shell script(bpm_cloud_migration.sh) was only tested against Ubuntu. So, if you don't have such OS, I recommend you to create your own Ubuntu VM or simply use Vagrant for creating and configure a lightweight, reproducible, and portable development environment for testing this script. 
3) You can give a try on this migration by simply running with the samples provided. Also, you can copy your own Oracle BPM exported application (.exp) file under the folder "BPM project samples" or any other folder you want to create under the same directory where the shell script resides.

Please review the following videos or the link to the blog post above if you have any questions
